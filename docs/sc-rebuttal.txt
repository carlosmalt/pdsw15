We thank the reviewers for their time and thoughtful suggestions.

Reviewer 1: "Nevertheless, the paper is good and will be of interest to the community."

1) How linked to CephFS is this system?

2) Can this technique be more sophisticated?

3) Why didn't we use different kinds of loads (instead of just creates in separate directories)?

Reviewer 2: "The paper's well written."

1) Is compiling Linux and creating a bunch of files in a directory representative of supercomputing loads? Why isn't there a suit of file-intensive scientific laods?
